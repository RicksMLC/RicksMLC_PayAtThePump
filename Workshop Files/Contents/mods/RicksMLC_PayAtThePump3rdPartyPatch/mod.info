description= Patch for Treads compatibility for FuelAPI.  It also fixes the same issue with PzkVanillaPlusCarPack <LINE>
description= Treads and PZK will show a red error box if fueling from a gas pump is halted due to not having any funds or running out of funds.
description= When Pay & Pump detects the player no longer has any funds in the main inventory it sends a forceStop() to the refuel action.
description= Unfortunately the Treads and PZK have overridden the vanilla "start()" with a copy of the vanilla code which has an error (the self.sound is not set).
description= This causes the "stop()" to call stopOrTriggerSound(self.sound) and since it is not set the vanilla code will error.
description= This Pay & Pump 3rd Party Patch restores the vanilla "start()" function so it runs instead of Treads and PZK.
